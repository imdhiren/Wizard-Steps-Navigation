# Wizard-Steps-Navigation
Wizard control eliminates the need to design forms to execute a step by step process in the actual business flow. This simplifies the work of developers to design and write the code. 

The control provides a mechanism that allows you to easily build the desired wizard as a collection of steps, add a new step, or reorder the steps. You don't have to write any infrastructure whatsoever for navigation or to persist user data between steps.
